# MATCH
Measure Alignment Through Comparative Human Judgement for FCM Extraction
---

## Description
This project seeks to fine-tune LLMs for the task of causal relation extraction. Datum will consist of short passages (e.g., sentences) from scholarly documents such as research articles. Passages are associated to signed, directed edges of a causal relation graph. These edges are encoded in text responses and serve as targets for next-token prediction. There's a lot ot unpack here, but don't be intimidated! We'll discuss each concept in turn.
