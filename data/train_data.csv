If, for example, various groups are involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of a food security programme, the interaction and dialogue among these groups can build social cohesion and reduce the risk of violence.
Yet, just because food assistance efforts take place in a protracted crisis or in a con- flict-affected country, it does not mean that they necessarily contribute to peace. They can, for example, undermine investment in local food production and the development of local capacity. If done right, however, food assistance can help to transform the vicious cycle of food insecurity and conflict into a virtuous cycle of food security: the risk of violence can be reduced (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011, p. 15). To address root causes, peacebuilding needs to be based on conflict analysis.

5002,"Peacebuilding is as much about an outcome as it is about a process. If, for example, various groups are involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of a food security programme, the interaction and dialogue among these groups can build social cohesion and reduce the risk of violence.
Yet, just because food assistance efforts take place in a protracted crisis or in a con- flict-affected country, it does not mean that they necessarily contribute to peace. They can, for example, undermine investment in local food production and the development of local capacity. If done right, however, food assistance can help to transform the vicious cycle of food insecurity and conflict into a virtuous cycle of food security: the risk of violence can be reduced (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011, p. 15). To address root causes, peacebuilding needs to be based on conflict analysis. Deeper understandings of the drivers of conflict allow actors to work on conflict, rather than in conflict, and to reduce the risks behind violence (Woodrow and Chigas 2009).",Conflict analysis,Peacebuilding,Positive,545,ronak_patel_csv,712

3302,"PPPs are another way for the public sector to help the private sector contribute to nutrition. In PPPs, public and private sector actors engage in open discussions to identify joint interests and opportunities for joint investment (Gillespie et al., 2013; Hoddinott, Gillespie and Yosef, 2015). Sustainable PPPs must identify and boost opportunities for private actors to make profits (Hoddinott, Gillespie and Yosef, 2015). The PPP approach is increasingly popular; Hoddinott, Gillespie and Yosef (2015), however, warn that good governance ? for instance, the clear definition of roles, transparent monitoring and the discussion of 1 Caterers involved in the programme reported challenges related to seasonal price variations that are not considered in payments, increased enrolment throughout the school year that is not reflected in payments, and late payments that make it difficult to buy in bulk and negotiate lower prices (Gelli et al., 2019). potential conflicts of interests ? is critical to their functioning; in addition, involving multiple businesses in a PPP can be problematic as competitors are asked to collaborate. The authors find that PPPs are most suited to situations where public solutions are not readily available, but the potential benefits to nutrition of intervention are very high (and risks are low). Koko Plus, a fortified flavour packet that is added to porridge for weaning, is an example of a PPP in Ghana that has both nutrition and profit objectives (Ghosh et al., 2014).",Public-private partnerships,Identification of joint interests/opportunities for joint investments,Positive,592,ronak_patel_csv,759
