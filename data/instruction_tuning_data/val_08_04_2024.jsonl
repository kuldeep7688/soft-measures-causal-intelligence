Increases in production of this magnitude using current agricultural methods would greatly increase con- sumption of natural resources and be unsustainable. The “holy grail” for future agriculture is therefore sustainable intensification achieved by means of new agri-technologies (Royal Society, 2009; Garnett et al., 2013). However, given the huge waste of both\n\nproduct and resource across the agri-food system (West et al., 2014), and the impracticality of some of the estimates of the required increase in production (which could exceed the primary productive capacity of plant earth) (Smil, 2013), there is an alter- native system view to address this grand challenge: food security via increased resource efficiency. Thus, the challenge is not only about producing more food, but about ways to improve resource efficiency integrated throughout the diverse configurations of the global agri-food system, both in terms of food production and food consumption.
