This comes about partly as a result of working closely with communities. In Liberia, for example, the evaluation of a protracted relief and recovery operation found that 90 per- cent of the 1,200 participants interviewed believed that the short-term jobs, provided through the operation, had helped to pro- mote peace and reconciliation (WFP 2009a). This percentage of positive replies was higher than for skills learned or improvements in living conditions. Greater social cohesion can result even from brief exposure to new community-based participatory institutions (Fearon et al. 2009). WFP worked alongside other humanitarian agenciestofacilitatethereturnofIDPsinthe Blolequin area of Co?te d’Ivoire. Bitter land disputes erupted as IDPs returned to resettle. IDP camps surrounded the village of Gohog- behi. For some time, mutual fear between the IDPs and Gohogbehi residents had brought work on the plantations to a standstill, and the bridges joining the village and the camps were destroyed. Talks between WFP and the two communities led to an agreement whereby the parties would receive a one- month general food distribution followed by three months of food for work in exchange for rehabilitating the bridges. Both commu- nities received their general food distribu- tion at the same location; and constructing the bridges together gave them an oppor- tunity to live and work together. Today, the two communities co-exist peacefully, goods and people circulate freely and access to the town is ensured. Food assistance has helped these communities to develop social cohe- sion (WFP 2009b).

In fact, involving communities in the design and implementation of programmes and having an inclusive approach to programmes will contribute to peacebuilding outcomes.

This intuitive link has been described by a long line of descriptive research in public health (Chen, Chowdhury, and Huffman 1980; Young and Jaspars 2009),1 but causally identifying and especially quantifying this link is particularly difficult. The reason is that common unobservable factors, such as genetic endowment or conflict-time food and health systems, are very likely to affect both nutrition and mortality directly. Yet, there is now robust evidence confirming that the link is substantive and substantial. In a rigorous study from Burundi, for instance, Verwimp (2012) estimates that the nutritional deficiencies from one year of conflict exposure causally increased boys’ mortality risk by 25 percentage points.

During the course of a conflict food systems are often damaged, this includes direct damage such as the destruction of crops or arable land, but also includes the diversion of labour away from the agricultural sectors and in some cases entails a reduction 1in capital investments in the agricultural sector (Teodosijevi?, 2003). Most conflicts tend to be highly localised (Raleigh et al., 2010), but due to its disruptive effect on the agricultural sector is thas to potential to have a national impact. As an example, Teodosijevi? (2003) showed that during conflict years production levels dropped which has negative consequences for food supply levels.

If, for example, various groups are involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of a food security programme, the interaction and dialogue among these groups can build social cohesion and reduce the risk of violence.\nYet, just because food assistance efforts take place in a protracted crisis or in a con- flict-affected country, it does not mean that they necessarily contribute to peace. They can, for example, undermine investment in local food production and the development of local capacity. If done right, however, food assistance can help to transform the vicious cycle of food insecurity and conflict into a virtuous cycle of food security: the risk of violence can be reduced (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011, p. 15). To address root causes, peacebuilding needs to be based on conflict analysis. Deeper understandings of the drivers of conflict allow actors to work on conflict, rather than in conflict, and to reduce the risks behind violence (Woodrow and Chigas 2009).

In PPPs, public and private sector actors engage in open discussions to identify joint interests and opportunities for joint investment (Gillespie et al., 2013; Hoddinott, Gillespie and Yosef, 2015). Sustainable PPPs must identify and boost opportunities for private actors to make profits (Hoddinott, Gillespie and Yosef, 2015). The PPP approach is increasingly popular; Hoddinott, Gillespie and Yosef (2015), however, warn that good governance ? for instance, the clear definition of roles, transparent monitoring and the discussion of 1 Caterers involved in the programme reported challenges related to seasonal price variations that are not considered in payments, increased enrolment throughout the school year that is not reflected in payments, and late payments that make it difficult to buy in bulk and negotiate lower prices (Gelli et al., 2019). potential conflicts of interests ? is critical to their functioning; in addition, involving multiple businesses in a PPP can be problematic as competitors are asked to collaborate. The authors find that PPPs are most suited to situations where public solutions are not readily available, but the potential benefits to nutrition of intervention are very high (and risks are low). Koko Plus, a fortified flavour packet that is added to porridge for weaning, is an example of a PPP in Ghana that has both nutrition and profit objectives (Ghosh et al., 2014).

Yemen is over 90 per cent dependent on imports for staple commodities such as wheat and rice; the UN estimates that 80 per cent of all imports for the north currently pass through Hodeida.6 Under the cover of UN Security Council Resolution 2216 (April 2015), which called for an arms embargo against Huthi/Saleh forces, the Saudi-led coalition aggressively imposed a naval blockade for the first year of the war.

This is a product of shrinking state finances, an acute liquidity crisis and the bank’s inability to move financial resources between areas controlled by conflict parties. The issue has be- come deeply politicised. Prior to President Hadi’s 19 September decision to move the central bank from Sanaa to Aden, there had been a tacit agreement between the war- ring sides to allow the institution to function relatively free of interference. Diplo- mats and economists widely agreed that the bank had remained largely impartial, facilitating the import of an increasingly limited list of basic commodities, protecting the value of the riyal and paying public-sector salaries nationally under increasingly difficult economic circumstances. But this did not last. Without revenues from hydro- carbons, which accounted for approximately half the government’s budget in 2014, or donor support, both solvency and immediate liquidity came under immense strain.11 [/INST]\nCausal Relation Triples : <triplet> political interference in central bank's functioning <subj> negative <obj> payment of public sector salaries </s>"}

Increasing attention has been given to the role that food insecurity and food prices may play in precipitating or exacerbating armed conflict, and the vicious cycle that can result.58 Overall, there is evidence that there are indeed such links, but only under to the street—there are often additional grievances such as corruption and inequality.
